# MP9_plugin
The latest cool ass SMG for Receiver 2!<br>

Also check out: [MagLoaderThing](https://github.com/CiarenceW/MagLoaderThing), this un-cuts a thing in the Compound that makes reloading big magazines like the ones for this gun lightning fast!  
And [this](https://github.com/CiarenceW/r2_CustomCompoundAmmoBoxes) as well, it adds ammo boxes for modded cartridges in the Compound, with possibilities of adding custom models for them too!

 ## Usage & Features
 - Go to the debug menu, and start the custom campaign, or go to the debug menu and spawn the gun + ammo in.
 - Press "V" to change fire mode
 - I actually spent like 3 hours animating most of the components in the trigger group, if you could check them out I'd appreciate it.
 - The stock doesn't work.
 - idk it's a gun, what else do you want me to say :(
